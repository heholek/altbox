## Alternative tools

The standard Unix tools have lasted us for decades.  Every programmer
should know them, but there are plenty of tools that add on to the standard
tools.  For example, `grep` works fine for finding text, but tools like
[`ack`](/ack/) and [`ripgrep`](/ripgrep/) are designed for today's modern
programmer working with large trees of heterogeneous source code.
