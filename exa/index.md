`exa` is a modern replacement for the command-line program `ls` that ships
with Unix and Linux operating systems, with more features and better
defaults.  It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows
about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And itâ€™s small, fast, and
just one single binary.

By deliberately making some decisions differently, `exa` attempts to be a
more featureful, more user-friendly version of `ls`.
