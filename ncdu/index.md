`ncdu` (for **NC**urses **D**isk **U**sage) is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses
interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you
don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool
even on regular desktop systems.  `ncdu` aims to be fast, simple and easy
to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment
with ncurses installed.
