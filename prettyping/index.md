`prettyping` presents the results of `ping` in a color-coded graphical way live on the command line.

* Detects missing/lost packets and marks them at the output.
* Shows live statistics, updated after each response is received.
* Two sets of statistics are calculated: one for the most recent 60 responses, and another for all responses since the start of the script.
* No installation required, just run the script from anywhere
